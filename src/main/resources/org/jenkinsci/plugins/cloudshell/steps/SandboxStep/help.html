    This step will execute the code in the closure in the context of a new sandbox. A CloudShell Sandbox will be created and set up prior
    to executing the code. The Sandbox Id will be accessible inside the closure as an environment variable, as seen in the example code.
    The Sandbox will always be ended after exiting the closure.
    NOTE: This step was designed for demo purposes only and not suitable for production usage.
